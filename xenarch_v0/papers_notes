Prior Indigenous Technological Species

Remaining technosignatures surviving erosion
Searching for Non-Terrestrial artifacts
	Avoid monocultural fallacy:: Abandoned/extinguished for some reason

How long would evidence last? 
	Recency of species:
	Ice/tar ~ 10k, mining ~10 Mya
	On ~100's Mya ~100's Gya, plate tectonics destroy all evidence
Fossil evidence
	Possible complex life before fossil record
		Cambrian explosion ~540 Mya >> most of fossil record
